# CRIS-internship-project
Predictive Forecasting of maintenance block delay using ML and Deep learning
The purpose of this project is to address the critical issue of maintenance delays, known as bursts, in the Indian railway networks. Efficient railway operation is crucial for ensuring timely arrivals and departures of trains, which is dependent on the availability of free tracks. Maintenance teams are responsible for checking faults such as cracks, cable issues, and vibrations within a permitted time duration. However, delays often occur, leading to significant disruptions in railway operations.

This project involves analyzing a large dataset comprising over 1.5 million rows with various factors such as railway zone, division, control division, block station ID, board ID, subsection, and more. The goal is to predict the extent of maintenance delays using machine learning models.

Using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, and imblearn, different machine learning models were employed to achieve this objective. Models like logistic regression, SVM classifier and regressor, random forest regressor and classifier, and neural networks were explored. The project successfully achieved a 80% accuracy in predicting the burst values, demonstrating the potential of these models in forecasting maintenance delays.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the methods and techniques used, the results obtained, and the insights gained from the analysis. It serves as a testament to the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world problems in the railway industry.
